# Single table inheritance with TypeORM experiment
Experiment for Contracts with 2 possible signatures: electronic and signing by payment. 
Both are stored in a single table in SQLite using TypeOrm.

## Getting started
`yarn start` starts the experiment and creates a `db.sqlite` in the root of the project. 
The experiment will log the output to the console.
